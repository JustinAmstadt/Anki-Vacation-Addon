# About 

This addon takes all cards that are due to review and spreads them out evenly over the next 6 days. 

# Installation

Just drop it in your addons folder, unzip it and it should work.

# How to Use

You can find the button in Tools -> Reschedule

# Warning

I would recommend making a backup before doing it just in case. I've tested it, but you could potentially seriously mess with your whole deck if something goes wrong. It's simple, so it shouldn't, but I would still make a backup until you feel safe with it.
